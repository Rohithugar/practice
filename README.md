## üìä Understanding Snowflake Schema vs. Star Schema in SQL
This repository explores the differences between Snowflake Schema and Star Schema in SQL database design:

## ‚≠ê Star Schema
Design: A central fact table connected to multiple dimension tables.

Advantages: Simpler queries, faster performance, easier to understand.

Use Case: Ideal for small to medium-sized data warehouses with straightforward relationships.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Snowflake Schema

Design: A normalized extension of the star schema with dimension tables further normalized into sub-dimensions.

Advantages: Reduced data redundancy, more efficient storage.

Use Case: Suitable for large, complex data warehouses with intricate relationships and the need for normalized data.
